Virtual CFO
We believe that a CFO (Chief Finance Officer) is the heartbeat of any successful organization. Successful CFOs partner with business owners and other managers in making critical decisions which directly impact the success of your business.
Why Do I Need a Virtual CFO?
Since most entrepreneurs have to labour long and hard to get their companies where they want to be, they have to wear a number of different hats. If you are an entrepreneur, you have certainly felt, at some point, as if you’re doing everything by yourself! 
In such a case, you need a strategic partner for managing and reviewing accounts, preparing annual budgets, tax planning and much more. In short, you need someone who can complement your finance & accounting team and manage your expanding ventures. At the same time, you can’t afford a CFO who demands a fat salary!
Recruiting this heartbeat is not an easy task and comes with a huge cost to company. Not every business can afford this bill.

For this very reason, we at Hanif Habib & Cco. provide Virtual CFO services.
