# UI Fixes - June 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. PDF Viewer Zoom Cutoff Issue
**Problem**: When zooming PDFs, content was being cut off from the left side and users couldn't scroll to see the full content.

**Solution**:
- Improved container styling with padding and proper centering
- Removed fixed width constraint when zoom scale is greater than 1.0
- Added a wrapper div with flex centering for better alignment
- PDFs now properly center and allow full scrolling when zoomed

**Files Modified**: `src/shared/components/ui/PDFViewer.tsx`

### 2. Mobile Hover-Only Buttons
**Problem**: Preview and Download buttons on MediaPublicationCard only appeared on hover, which doesn't work on mobile devices.

**Solution**:
- Added always-visible buttons specifically for mobile devices
- Desktop retains the hover interaction for better aesthetics
- Mobile buttons are positioned at the bottom with a gradient background
- Slightly smaller button size on mobile for better space utilization

**Files Modified**: `src/features/media/components/MediaPublicationCard.tsx`

### 3. Initial Card Visibility on Resources Page
**Problem**: When opening the Resources page, cards wouldn't appear until the user scrolled, creating a blank page experience.

**Solution**:
- Added a loading state that ensures cards are visible on initial render
- Cards now show immediately while still maintaining scroll animations
- Improved TypeScript types for the filter function
- Better user experience with no blank initial state

**Files Modified**: `src/features/resources/pages/Resources.tsx`

## Testing Recommendations

1. **PDF Zoom Testing**:
   - Open any PDF in the viewer
   - Use zoom in/out buttons
   - Verify content remains centered and scrollable at all zoom levels
   - Test on both mobile and desktop

2. **Mobile Button Testing**:
   - Open Media Publications on a mobile device
   - Verify Preview and Download buttons are always visible
   - Test button functionality

3. **Resources Page Testing**:
   - Navigate to Resources page
   - Verify cards appear immediately without scrolling
   - Check that scroll animations still work as expected
