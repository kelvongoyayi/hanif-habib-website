# UI Fixes - June 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. PDF Loading Stuck Issue - NEW FIX
**Problem**: PDFs were stuck in "Loading..." state and never displayed.

**Solution**:
- Removed external loading state management
- Let react-pdf's Document component handle loading internally
- Ensured Document component is always rendered when there's no error
- Passed proper loading component to Document's loading prop

**Files Modified**: `src/shared/components/ui/PDFViewer.tsx`

### 2. PDF Viewer Zoom Cutoff Issue - UPDATED
**Problem**: When zooming PDFs, content was being cut off from the left and top sides and users couldn't scroll to see the full content.

**Solution**:
- Restructured the container with proper overflow handling
- Used absolute positioning within a relative container for better control
- Removed fixed width constraints completely
- Added nested containers with proper overflow settings
- PDFs now properly center and allow full scrolling in all directions when zoomed

**Files Modified**: `src/shared/components/ui/PDFViewer.tsx`

### 3. Mobile Preview/Download Buttons - UPDATED
**Problem**: Always-visible buttons on mobile didn't look good and cluttered the interface.

**Solution**:
- Changed to tap-to-show behavior on mobile (similar to desktop hover)
- Buttons now appear with gradient overlay when card is tapped
- Added visual tap indicator (eye icon) on mobile to hint at interactivity
- Clicking outside the card closes the button overlay
- Better user experience with cleaner interface

**Files Modified**: `src/features/media/components/MediaPublicationCard.tsx`

### 4. Initial Card Visibility on Resources Page
**Problem**: When opening the Resources page, cards wouldn't appear until the user scrolled, creating a blank page experience.

**Solution**:
- Added a loading state that ensures cards are visible on initial render
- Cards now show immediately while still maintaining scroll animations
- Improved TypeScript types for the filter function
- Better user experience with no blank initial state

**Files Modified**: `src/features/resources/pages/Resources.tsx`

## Testing Recommendations

1. **PDF Zoom Testing**:
   - Open any PDF in the viewer
   - Use zoom in/out buttons multiple times
   - Verify content remains accessible in all directions
   - Test scrolling in all directions when zoomed
   - Test on both mobile and desktop

2. **Mobile Button Testing**:
   - Open Media Publications on a mobile device
   - Tap on a card to show Preview and Download buttons
   - Tap outside to hide buttons
   - Verify the eye indicator is visible on mobile only

3. **Resources Page Testing**:
   - Navigate to Resources page
   - Verify cards appear immediately without scrolling
   - Check that scroll animations still work as expected
