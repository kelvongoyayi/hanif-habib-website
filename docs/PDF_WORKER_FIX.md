# PDF Worker Configuration Fix

## Issue
The deployed site was showing the error:
```
Failed to load PDF: Setting up fake worker failed: "Failed to resolve module specifier 'pdf.worker.mjs'"
```

## Root Cause
- The project uses `react-pdf` v9.2.1 which requires `pdfjs-dist` v4.8.69
- React-pdf v9.x expects the worker file in ES module format (`.mjs`)
- The old worker file was in legacy format (`.js`)

## Solution Applied

### 1. Downloaded Correct Worker File
```bash
curl -o public/pdf.worker.min.mjs https://unpkg.com/pdfjs-dist@4.8.69/build/pdf.worker.min.mjs
```

### 2. Updated Worker Configuration
Modified `src/shared/utils/pdfWorker.ts` to:
- Prioritize local `.mjs` worker file for better performance
- Fall back to CDN if local file fails
- Removed reference to old `.js` worker file

### 3. Added Error Handling
Updated `src/shared/components/ui/PDFViewer.tsx` to:
- Automatically retry with CDN worker if local worker fails
- Provide better error messages
- Add retry count to force re-render on retry

### 4. Updated Deployment Configurations
Added proper headers for worker files in:
- `vercel.json`: Added headers for JavaScript MIME type and CORS
- `netlify.toml`: Added similar headers for both deployment platforms

## Deployment Checklist
1. Ensure `pdf.worker.min.mjs` exists in the `public` folder
2. Deploy to your platform (Vercel/Netlify)
3. Clear browser cache and test PDF viewing functionality
4. Check browser console for any worker-related errors

## Future Maintenance
- When updating `react-pdf`, ensure the worker file version matches
- Keep the worker file in the public folder for faster loading
- Monitor browser console for any worker-related warnings
