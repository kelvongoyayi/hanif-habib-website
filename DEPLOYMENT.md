3. Configure your server to serve `index.html` for all routes

## 🔧 Environment Variables

If you need environment variables:
1. Create `.env` file (already gitignored)
2. Add variables prefixed with `VITE_`:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://api.example.com
   ```
3. Access in code: `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL`

## 📱 Post-Deployment

After deployment:
1. Test all pages and navigation
2. Verify PDF viewer functionality
3. Check contact form submissions
4. Test on mobile devices
5. Verify SSL certificate (HTTPS)

## 🔄 Continuous Deployment

Both Vercel and Netlify offer automatic deployments:
- Every push to `main` branch triggers a new deployment
- Pull requests get preview deployments

## 📊 Performance

The build includes:
- Minified JavaScript and CSS
- Optimized images
- Code splitting for PDFViewer
- Caching headers for assets

Note: There's a chunk size warning (935KB) which is common for React apps. Consider lazy loading more components if needed.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check build logs for errors
2. Ensure Node.js version compatibility
3. Clear cache and retry
4. Verify all environment variables are set
